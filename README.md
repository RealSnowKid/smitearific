## How to Setup for Development
This section explains how to setup the project locally to be ready for development.

### Prerequisites
* An IDE (Visual Studio Code with Java extenstions recommended, could also use IntelliJ IDEA for the Java back-end)
* A local database (MySQL recommended)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository
```bash
git clone https://github.com/RealSnowKid/smitearific
```

2. Install dependencies for the Web App and run it
```bash
cd smitearific_web_app
npm install
npm run dev
```

3. Create an *application-dev.properties* file for all APIs

*The currently available APIs are info and stats*
```bash
cd smitearific_api\[api-name]\src\main\resources
cp application.properties application-dev.properties
```
*Modify the values in the new file according to your environment, it is recommended to add a server.port value also.*

4. Start the APIs
```bash
cd smitearific_api\[api-name]\src\main\resources
mvn spring-boot:run -D spring-boot.run.profiles=dev
```
Now the project is set-up locally, and is ready for development
*Note: The APIs need to be restarted after changes occur.*
