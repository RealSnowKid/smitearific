To famed Achilles, invincible warrior, the king gave command of a thousand ships.\\n\\nAcross stormy seas and salted beach, soldiers sieged the city. Arrow and stone, blade and barb bounced from Achilles\u2019 skin. Bathed as a babe in the River Styx by his Nereid mother, his hide was hardened, imperviously made. Through every charge, every death-defying battle, Achilles was at the fore. Troy hung poised to crumble.\\n\\nUntil Agamemnon gave slight to the mighty myrmidon. In grave offense, Achilles pulled his forces from the field. Hector, boldest, bravest, eldest of the Trojan princes seized the chance to push the Greeks to the sea. Water\u2019s reflection mirrored scorching sails as Hector fired their ships. All seemed lost until Achilles rose to meet him. Fierce and fast the two titans fought, but Hector\u2019s spear felled Achilles fair. Though Patroclus, it was, in the armor of Achilles, not Achilles who lay dead.\\n\\nWrathful at the loss of his faithful friend, Achilles donned armor newly-made and challenged Hector alone. Spear and blade and amor rang, but Achilles could not be harmed. Hector, prince of Troy, died in battle that day.\\n\\nParis, brother lost, tearful-eyed, let arrow loose, guided by divine envy. For there were Gods that could not suffer Achilles to survive. Straight and true the arrow flew and harpooned Achilles\u2019 heel, where his mother held him when submerged. The wound was deep, his weakness found, Achilles met his end.\\n\\nA decade thence, from Hades\u2019 depths, Achilles has been drawn. Armored now, upon the heel, revenge his only aim. For envious Gods stole from him his glory and his life.

They protected the ship at dawn and dusk from the world serpent, Apep, who lurked at the horizon. Courageous, formidable, and above all, intelligent, Anhur defended the vessel with his spear and wits, outsmarting and distracting the serpent until feral Bastet delivered a killing blow.  With Apep gone, Ra became Pharaoh, Bastet, the Goddess of Cats and Women, and Anhur donned the mantle of the God of War.  This is how he became known as the Slayer of Enemies.\\n\\nAs time went on, another feline Goddess, Menhet, ran away from the Pantheon, spurning Ra. Anhur vowed to bring her back from the distant lands of Nubia to appease his father, but when he finally caught up with Menhet, he was enraptured and fell in love. He tied a rope to her neck and led her home, where he requested Menhet become his wife, a boon Ra happily granted.\\n\\nFor Egyptians, warfare is more than bloody battle, it's a means to break the chains of tyranny. Anhur can be found at the head of any charge, crushing corruption and leading the people to freedom. While his spear is deadly, Anhur is cunning and clever, able to outmaneuver opponents in ways they least expect.","PhysicalPower":40,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/shifting-sands.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.69,"Mana":220,"ManaPerLevel":35,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/anhur.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Anhur's spear attacks reduce the enemy target's Physical Protection for 3 seconds.","rankitems":[{"description":"Physical Protection Debuff:","value":"20"}],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Debuff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Enemy"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"80/90/100/110/120","cooldown":"75s","description":"Summoning the fury of the desert, Anhur hunkers down and throws empowered spears that pass through everything, doing damage to all enemies in their path.

That he rides to battle on a chariot drawn by fire-breathing steeds and delights only in the clash of battle and smell of bloodshed.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his father. Zeus has many sons, but only two with his wife Hera. However, the thunder God has long suspected Hera of having an affair that led to the birth of Ares, perhaps as revenge for all of Zeus\u2019 infidelity. For this, Zeus is disgusted by him.\\n\\nAres is not loved by his sister. Athena and Ares are both Gods of War. Where Ares represents violence, force, and slaughter, Athena is the embodiment of intelligence, strategy, and leadership. Ares is quick to act and leave a bloody trail. Athena is thoughtful and careful with lives. Often they have been on the opposite sides, most notably at the Battle of Troy, where Athena viciously wounded him and forced Ares to retreat.\\n\\nAres is the lover of the Goddess of Beauty. Though Aphrodite is married to Ares\u2019 brother, Hephaestus, Ares takes what he wants, and Aphrodite gives in willingly. Their union created offspring almost as terrible as Ares himself: Phobos and Deimos, Fear and Terror.\\n\\nAres is loved only by the Spartans, who revere the God for his masculinity, his merciless warrior spirit, and tenacity against all odds. The Spartans, however, know the unpredictable fury of their patron, and bind his statues in chains. This is, in part, to prevent Ares\u2019 spirit of victory from escaping Sparta, and a vain effort to keep the God of War contained.","PhysicalPower":0,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/shackles.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.67,"Mana":200,"ManaPerLevel":37,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/ares.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Each completed aura item that Ares owns grants him 30 additional Magical Power.","rankitems":[],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"80/85/90/95/100","cooldown":"100s","description":"Ares throws chains out to all enemy gods in an area around him.

The twin demigods Otos and Ephialtes, who could not be killed except by each other, threatened to kidnap Artemis and force her to marry one of them, but were tricked when Artemis, appearing as a doe, dashed between them. As they thrust with their spears they impaled each other. Finally, Actaeon, after peeping at Artemis while she bathed, was transformed into a stag and devoured by his own hunting dogs.

Straightening slowly, like aged men, trees and fauna of the underbrush, now free of snow-weight, reach for the sun. It is spring; the world awakens from darkness and death to grow green again. Her hibernation ends. Coat wet with fresh rain, Artio, Goddess-Bear, roars into the chill morning air.\\n\\nShe is guardian of the cycle. Not the passage of time, but the balance of things. There is no spring without winter, no death without life, no darkness without light, no goodness without evil. Nature declares these opposites into law and Artio is the enforcer.\\n\\nAmong the ursine she runs, sometimes in the shape of a woman, lithe and wild, sometimes as a bear, brown and fierce. Nowhere in the forest do there stand shrines in her name, for Artio is less worshipped and more respected. Perhaps, instead, she looms overhead, a constant presence in the twinkle of the stars, a connection of glistening light; the constellation Ursa Major.\\n\\nAnd now there is war. None could know peace without war, victory without defeat, glory without failure. Artio must join those that fight if only to enforce the cycle of things.

To Athena, a life is a precious thing that need not be wasted in frivolous battle. Bloodthirsty Ares, on the other hand, is reviled by their father and chained by his ravenous subjects.\\n\\nAt the Siege of Troy, Ares disobeyed Zeus and joined with the battle, fighting for the mortal Trojans.

Ares, for bloodstained victory, Athena for honor, valor, and the wisdom to fight with dignity. Make no mistake, these are times of war, and Ares has already answered the call to arms.

Perhaps the oldest story there is. In the dark woods, there is a witch called Baba Yaga. Sometimes she is a mother. Sometimes she is a daughter. Sometimes she is cruel and sometimes, kind. But always, Baba Yaga is cunning. And there is always a price to pay for dealing with her, if you are brave enough \u2013 or desperate enough \u2013 to seek her out.\\n\\nIt is said that Baba Yaga waits for travellers in her house atop its gnarled chicken legs, behind a fence made of human bones. If you are brave enough to pass through the fence and enter the house you will see her stretched out across the interior, looming over her stove, or reaching out from one corner to another. Or, if you are in the woods late at night, you might see her flying overhead in her mortar and pestle and the hear the thunderous tramp of the chicken-legged house as it pursues its mistress.\\n\\nRegardless, she is an ugly creature with a long nose and cruel, iron teeth, and her eyes gleam with malice. But despite her inherent malevolence, she does not interfere with others without first being approached \u2013 or provoked. If you are foolish enough to seek her, she might well punish you for your effrontery before aiding you, or aid you and then tear you to pieces because it amuses her to do so. And sometimes, very rarely, she helps without harm.\\n\\nBut only when it suits her to do so.\\n\\nNow, as the world shudders on its axis and new horrors rise, Baba Yaga stirs in her long isolation. The gods have ignored her warnings for long enough, and if they will not ask for her help willingly, she will find a way to force them to do so\u2026","PhysicalPower":0,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/wild-witchcraft.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.5,"Mana":280,"ManaPerLevel":50,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/baba-yaga.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.7,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Baba Yaga's Cabin accumulates up to 100 essence over time, when it moves, and if enemy gods get too close.

None adhere more vigorously to this creed than Bacchus, the Roman God of Wine, lewd behavior, and madness.\\n\\nAfter spending much of his formative years with his impressively intoxicated mentor Solinus, whom Bacchus loves like a father, the God of Wine is now a wanderer and teacher. He\u2019s journeyed across all of Asia, through India, and finally back to Rome, spreading the \u201cMysteries of the Vine,\u201d a ritual involving incredible amounts of wine to lower inhibitions, freeing one from social constraints, oppression of gender, sexual taboos, and the stresses of life. Quite the successful ritual, if ever there was one.\\n\\nMuch of this ritual seems to have come from Solinus, who is widely known to have vast, secret knowledge and the ability to predict the future, though only while completely drunk. The king Midas, covetous of this knowledge, captured Solinus, endeavoring to extract it by providing the scholar the finest food, drink, and entertainment he could muster. Bacchus finally tracked down his mentor in the court of Midas and discovered him well fed and cared for. Quickly, Midas lied, claiming Solinus had been lost and the king had taken him in. Seeing through the ruse, Bacchus offered the monarch a boon. Midas asked that anything he touched be turned to gold. Without hesitation, Bacchus granted this. He tested his new gift on a twig and stone and found them turned completely to gold. Elated, Midas called a feast, but found his food turned to gold in his hands and his daughter solidified at his touch. Starving and crazed, Midas begged Bacchus to remove the \u201cgift.\u201d Bacchus acquiesced, allowing the greedy king to wash his hands in the Pactolus river. As the golden touch left his hands, the river sands transformed to glittering gold.\\n\\nOf course, the product of continuous overindulgence in alcohol and deviant behavior, Bacchus could simply be insane.","PhysicalPower":0,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/chug.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.8,"Mana":200,"ManaPerLevel":40,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/bacchus.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Bacchus loves the drink and as Bacchus drinks from his jug, he becomes more intoxicated, gaining Buffs when he gets Tipsy and Smashed.

Disguised as brahmins, they sought alms from the villagers in order to sustain themselves. They soon learned that a demon, Bakasura, was living outside the village, devouring the people as they passed through the woods. The chief went to the demon and begged that the feasting stop. In return, a cart of food would be sent to Bakasura each day. Bakasura consumed not only the provisions, but the person that brought the cart as well.\\n\\nAfter hearing this tale from a weeping woman whose son would bear the cart on the morrow, Kunti declared that her son Bhima, who possessed impossible strength and had slain demons before, would take the cart instead, as repayment to the kindness the villagers had shown their family.\\n\\nOnce in the forest, Bhima nonchalantly ate the food intended for Bakasura. Furious, Bakasura threatened to eat Bhima, which he just laughed off, goading the demon to attack him. All day they battled until Bhima finally slew the demon, tied him to the cart and dragged the body back to the village, where the people celebrated the victory in bewilderment.\\n\\nHunger, however, is a demon that cannot be defeated and, inevitably, Bakasura\u2019s disgusting rumble will rise again, now more ravenous than ever and ready to feed.","PhysicalPower":38,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/take-down.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.68,"Mana":200,"ManaPerLevel":39,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/bakasura.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Bakasura's attack and movement speed temporarily increases for each enemy that he kills.","rankitems":[{"description":"Attack Speed per Stack:","value":"7%"},{"description":"Movement Speed per Stack:","value":"7%"},{"description":"Buff Duration:","value":"10s"},{"description":"Max Stacks:","value":"3"}],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"80/90/100/110/120","cooldown":"90/85/80/75/70s","description":"Bakasura regurgitates all of the minions consumed by his Eat Minion ability at his ground target location that Slows for 3s and Cripples enemy players.

With only his bare hands, the boy defended himself and slew the beast. Ashamed, Sétanta swore to Culann he would personally train a new dog and would guard his home in the interim. Impressed, the druid Cathbad declared Sétanta would now be called the Cú Chulainn, the Hound of Culann.\\n\\nThis was the birth of a hero, but his death was yet bound in prophecy.

He is the God of love and desire, flying about on feathery wings, shooting passion-tipped arrows at all the creatures of the earth. When struck with one of his arrows, man and beast alike fall in love with the next thing they see. Without Cupid\u2019s steady aim, there would be no love in this world, which is precisely what happened when Cupid fell in love himself.\\n\\nPsyche was a mortal of astounding beauty, which made Venus venomously jealous. Venus ordered Cupid to sting her with an arrow, then arranged for Psyche to fall in love with a spider. Invisible, Cupid reluctantly went to Psyche as she slept, yet, she woke suddenly and saw right through Cupid\u2019s invisibility. Surprised, Cupid cut himself on his own arrow and fell immediately in love with Psyche.\\n\\nFurious, Venus would not let Cupid marry Psyche, so Cupid stopped shooting arrows, people stopped falling in love and stopped worshipping Venus. Panicked, the Goddess of beauty relented and Cupid went back to work. Psyche was whisked to a secret location. Cupid visited her only at night so she could not see who he was. Fearing him to be a terrible monster, Psyche waited for Cupid to fall asleep and lit a lantern. Surprised at what she found, she accidentally scraped one of Cupid\u2019s arrows and fell in love with him.\\n\\nVenus was displeased and forbade Psyche to see her son, forcing her to complete a series of impossible challenges that Psyche overcame only with mystical help. Finally, Cupid begged Jupiter (Zeus) to intervene. Casually, he declared Psyche and Cupid could be together. Thus, Cupid fed Psyche the drink of ambrosia that made her immortal and the God of love got to live happily ever after.","PhysicalPower":35,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/heart-bomb.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.67,"Mana":230,"ManaPerLevel":39,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/cupid.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Every hit with a Basic Attack gives Cupid a Heart Stack that increases the damage or healing of his abilities.

They can be petty, churlish, and worst of all, wrong. What are the consequences for their mistakes? They should have slain the wolf-beast Fenrir, but they chose instead to bind him. Despite the warnings and prophecies he would tear Odin apart at Ragnorok and devour the earth and sky, they did not end Loki's son. Now, terror roams free. It is unknown how, but Fenrir is Unbound.\\n\\nThrice they tried to bind him, each time convincing Fenrir that the chains were nothing more than a challenge for his strength, a test to see if he could shatter them. The first two God-forged fetters were easily broken beneath the beast\u2019s terrible power, but the third was a ribbon, dwarf made, and Fenrir grew suspicious of the God\u2019s intentions. As a show of faith, he demanded one of them place a hand in his mouth, and if the ribbon proved magical in nature, he would exact punishment. Brave, if foolish, Tyr put his fist in Fenrir\u2019s maw as the ribbon was secured to the wolf\u2019s leg. Fenrir strained and screamed, but could not break free, and in rage, he devoured Tyr\u2019s hand.\\n\\nFor a time, Fenrir was forgotten, the dire prophecy just a memory. But they were all warned and the Gods did nothing. Fenrir is hungry now, the first hunter, an alpha among sheep, but no flesh will satisfy his need.

But Freya is proud and strong, with the cunning to escape her enemies and ruthlessly retaliate. Every rose bears thorns, but this one wields swords.\\n\\nWere it up to her, Freya would have little to do with blood and blades.

Ruler of the realm of Sessrumnir, a place much like Valhalla, where the souls of dead warriors spend eternity, Freya provides comfort and bliss to the fallen.\\n\\nOnce, Freya was married to the mysterious and elusive God, Od. Immediately following their wedding, Od went on a journey to distant and inhospitable lands. So long was he gone the Gods presumed him dead. Distraught and heartbroken, Freya spilled tears of gold and searched the globe for him. Finally, she discovered him ship-wrecked and twisted into a hideous sea monster. Melancholy but loyal, she stayed and comforted him. Though one night, while she slept, a daring hunter slew the beast Od had become. Moved by Freya\u2019s utter despair, the Gods agreed to allow Od into Sussrumnir, despite the fact he had not died in battle, so he and Freya could remain together forever.","PhysicalPower":0,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/irradiate.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.52,"Mana":220,"ManaPerLevel":37,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/freya.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Freya's necklace grants her additional Magical Lifesteal.","rankitems":[{"description":"Magical Lifesteal:","value":"10% + 0.25% per Level"}],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"90/95/100/105/110","cooldown":"90s","description":"Freya uses her Cloak of Feathers to fly above the battlefield where she fires down blasts of Magical damage up to 4 times while flying.

As a God, he is a guardian of justice, a hero to the downtrodden, the Saint of War.\\n\\nIn the ancient times of the East, a great war between Three Kingdoms raged. The warlord Liu Bei, and his friends, Zheng Fei, and the mighty Guan Yu swore an oath of brotherhood in a mystical peach garden, vowing to create a new, righteous world. Together, they fought countless battles against the warlords Cao Cao and Sun Quan, and Guan Yu grew famous for his combat prowess and unwavering honor.\\n\\nDuring the war, Cao Cao captured Guan Yu. At the time, Liu Bei\u2019s fate was uncertain, so he agreed to fight for Cao Cao under specific terms, chiefly that he would abandon Cao Cao if ever he learned the whereabouts of his sworn brother. Despite Cao Cao\u2019s gifts and promises of wealth, when Liu Bei resurfaced, Guan Yu immediately went to his side. Years later, Guan Yu again faced Cao Cao on the battlefield as the warlord fled from his defeat at Red Cliffs. Guan Yu cut off Cao Cao\u2019s retreat and obliterated his forces. Cao Cao, however, he spared and released, as a matter of honor.\\n\\nAfter his death, Guan Yu\u2019s spirit remained at a holy shrine, coming to the aid of nearby villagers in need, battling the cruel and selfish. From all over the East, worshippers came to the shrine and burned incense to honor him. Such popularity led to Faith, and thus Guan Yu was raised as a God, deified a few hundred years later.\\n\\nNow, he embodies the virtues he lived by. His statues, wielding a massive guan dao, ward against evil. Red faced to represent loyalty, his likeness is carried by merchants as proof they can be trusted. If their cause is just, he leads armies to victory.

That a warrior can be honorable, can treat his enemies with respect, that he can retain his humanity. When there is war to be fought, this is the kind of warrior Hachiman teaches.\\n\\nPregnant with her unborn son, Hachiman, the Empress Jingu led a fierce campaign against the forces that slew her husband. Fearing her child\u2019s birth would slow the army\u2019s advance, she tied bandages about her belly and held him within for 3 years, until the war was done. Each day, she prayed she would not lose the child, that he would be born strong. That he would be a God. As 8 banners descended from heaven, heralding his birth, her prayers were answered.\\n\\nHachiman embodies all a warrior should be. Temperate but fearless. Deadly not ruthless.

Concealed in the Underworld, none could reach her, so Demeter cursed the land with a great famine. The other Gods pleaded with her to end it lest she destroy mankind, but she would not relent until her daughter was returned. Hades finally let Persephone leave, though not before feeding her pomegranate seeds. Having consumed the fruit, she was bound forever to Hades and required to return to her husband once per year to eat of the seeds again. This, it is said, is a time of mourning and the cause of winter.\\n\\nWhile many fear death and view it as evil, in truth, Hades endeavors only to keep balance. He is stern but fair.

The watchman of Asgard is a sentry without equal in the Nine Realms and he maintains his eternal watch where the rainbow bridge meets the sky. With sharp eyes and keen hearing, Heimdallr stands guard over the halls of the gods, alert for the approach of any enemy as well as the first stirrings of Ragnarok.\\n\\nIt is said that Heimdallr requires less sleep than a bird, and can see for hundreds of leagues. His hearing is so sharp that he can perceive the soft whisper of growing grass, and the murmur of the dead. His trumpet, Gjallarhorn, can be heard across the Nine Worlds when blown. But it is not only his senses which make Heimdallr a superb sentinel.\\n\\nHe also possesses the gift of foresight, allowing him to predict his opponent\u2019s moves before they occur and to sense the approach of inimical forces. As befitting one of the Aesir, he is a masterful combatant, and his foreknowledge gives him an edge over all but the most unpredictable \u2013 or skilled \u2013 of opponents.\\n\\nToo, it is whispered that Heimdallr has some connection to Yggdrasil, the World Tree. Some insist he was fashioned whole from a splinter of the great ash tree, while others believe he is bound to it in some fashion, much like Ratatoskr. Whatever the case, it is known that Heimdallr takes a dim view of any who might threaten Yggdrasil.\\n\\nThus, when his keen gaze settled upon the creeping tendrils of Persephone\u2019s minions, drawing ever closer to the World Tree, Heimdallr moved instantly to confront them.

An oracle of Jupiter advised he should pledge his service to the king Eurystheus, and so Hercules reluctantly did so. Jealous of the demigod, the king set him to twelve impossible tasks, expecting him to fail at the first, to slay the Nemean Lion and return with its hide.\\n\\nThe Nemean Lion captured women and devoured soldiers. Its fur was so thick no weapon could pierce it, and its claws so sharp, no armor could guard against them. Hercules tracked the lion to its mountain caves and drew it out, firing arrows that shattered against the beast\u2019s impenetrable coat. Agilely, he dodged as the lion leapt to maul him. In the end, Hercules aimed a powerful shot straight into the lion\u2019s roaring maw, a place the powerful fur did not protect, and slew it. Then, using the beasts own claws, he skinned the hide, wearing the mantle proudly as his new armor.\\n\\nEurystheus was aghast upon the hero\u2019s return. Immediately the legend of Hercules began to grow. Eleven more labours the confounded king set against him, but time after time, year after year, Hercules performed what could not be done, earning fame, glory, and the peace he so desperately sought.","PhysicalPower":39,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/driving-strike.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.63,"Mana":205,"ManaPerLevel":32,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/hercules.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Every time Hercules takes damage from an enemy god he gains a stacking self buff that provides increased Physical Power.","rankitems":[{"description":"Physical Power per Stack","value":"2 +1 per level"},{"description":"Duration:","value":"5s"},{"description":"Max Stacks:","value":"3"}],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"100","cooldown":"90/85/80/75/70s","description":"Hercules rips a huge boulder from the ground.

If such an adage holds true, then surely the heads that seek to wear it must as well.

Rather, it is strife, division and conflict that cling to him like a shadow. A shadow that has taken the form of his uncle, Set.\\n\\nSet stands in opposition to Horus\u2019 ascension to rule, challenging so that he might be the one to take the throne and hold the destiny of their pantheon, lands and mortal worshippers in the palm of his hand. Thus has begun a path of chaos and destruction that has claimed countless lives, including that of venerable Osiris himself. Reeling from the cold-blooded murder of his father by his own uncle, Horus swore an oath to all creation, on pain of his own death, to set right the horrific deeds that had been perpetrated, and restore order, peace and justice to the land.\\n\\nFor Horus, this conflict will see his kingdom restored to its full former glory, first among equals of all the Pantheons in creation, or should he fail, see all he knows and loves cast into darkness, corruption and ruin. He has become inextricably linked with Set, a shining reflection of his uncle\u2019s brooding darkness. Horus knows in his heart that Set will stop at nothing to achieve his aims, and so he must do the same. For the fate of all, he must prevail, no matter the cost.

When she was married, she became a Queen. But a legendary journey to resurrect her murdered husband would make her a savior.\\n\\nFrom the God of Earth and Goddess of Sky, Isis was born, and she was a Goddess in her own right, loved by wealthy and poor alike, champion to sinners and slaves, artisans and aristocrats. She commanded the force of magic, for she knew the True Names of many things. For in the True Names lie true power.\\n\\nIsis and her husband Osiris ruled Egypt, symbols of order and justice, and led their kingdom to true prosperity. But Osiris had a brother, Set, who harbored jealousy and malice, and sought to usurp his throne. For him, murder alone was not enough. Set hacked Osiris to pieces and cast them across Egypt.\\n\\nFleeing Set\u2019s wrath, Isis traveled the land in secret, gathering the remains of her husband. Meanwhile, Set\u2019s rule plunged the land into chaos incarnate, and all seemed truly lost. Unable to locate a final piece, Isis could wait no longer and summoned the potent powers of her magic to reassemble her husband and give him new life. That night, their love became a child, Horus, who would avenge his father and cast evil Set out of Egypt.\\n\\nHer bravery, tenacity, her skill and love drove Isis to save Egypt and become the mother of all Pharaohs. Long has she prayed that chaos would never again rise to threaten the rule of order and prosperity, but peaceful days are at an end. This time, it may not be her husband torn asunder, but all the world, and even the Goddess of Magic may not have the power to reassemble it from oblivion.","PhysicalPower":0,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/wing-gust.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.45,"Mana":280,"ManaPerLevel":51,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/isis.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.7,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Isis shares additional HP5 and MP5 with nearby allies.

At each end of his temple stand massive doors. In times of peace, these doors are closed, but in times of war, flung open. As Rome rose to power, rarely were these doors shut, but almost four hundred years of peace have clothed Rome since then and the temple has grown dusty with absence.

He was Arthur, son of Uther Pendragon, King and Warden of Camelot.\\n\\nHis coming was prophesied by the great wizard Merlin, glimpsed in a comet burning though the night sky, herald of the monarch who would unite all Camelot and usher her into a new age of peace and prosperity. Though little older than a boy when King Uther fell and the mantle of ruler was passed down to him, Arthur would rise and take hold of his destiny as savior of his people. Benevolent and adept in statecraft, honourable and cunning in war, Arthur was the symbol of a new Briton.\\n\\nIn his hand is Excalibur, that mythic blade of divine power that only the most just of rulers may wield. Ever since the fateful day she first came into his possession, the sword has never left Arthur\u2019s side, and countless are the foes he has brought low with her, the blade\u2019s power amplified even further by his exemplary prowess in battle.\\n\\nArthur has withstood any foe who has sought Camelot\u2019s downfall, be it the numberless hordes from beyond the seas or the sinister plots of those from within his own house. No matter the scheme, or the enemy, with the aid of his mage Merlin and his knights, Arthur has prevailed, for so long as he draws breath, Camelot\u2019s lord shall not rest until her safety is won.\\n\\nNow, the great King hears the call of Avalon, and answers.","PhysicalPower":39,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/overhead-slash.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.8,"Mana":230,"ManaPerLevel":40,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/king-arthur.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Each ability that damages a god results in a stack of Steadfast, reducing damage taken and increasing energy gain.

King among these monsters is Kuzenbo; bigger, stronger, and more cunning than the rest, but just as infantile.\\n\\nKuzenbo led his nine thousand Kappa followers to Japan, where they harried river villages and fishing boats, using their unnatural strength to pull mortals below. So clever, so hungry had the Kappa become, that Japan\u2019s army marched to fight back, but they were no match.\\n\\nAs the bowl-shaped indentation atop a Kappa\u2019s head is filled with water, that Kappa grows impossibly stronger - far stronger than a mortal. Yet, bound by their strange sense of honor, a Kappa must bow when bowed to, spilling their power upon the ground. It is the only known way to defeat one.\\n\\nAnd of the countless battles Kuzenbo has fought, he was defeated only twice. Upon his second defeat at the hands of General Kiyomasa, Kuzenbo was forced to swear to never again sow strife between man and beast.

A collector of secrets and ancient lore, Merlin is a master of arcane wizardry, able to wield a myriad of elements and harness them to his will. He also devoted his mind to the art of prophesy, one day foreseeing the rise of a ruler destined to stand above all others, and unite the land beneath his banner.\\n\\nWhen Uther Pendragon fell in battle against the barbarous hordes of the invading Saxons, Merlin swore an oath of fealty to his successor, Arthur. From that day, the mage never left the wielder of legendary Excalibur\u2019s side, a tireless advisor, fellow warrior, and friend. Together they brought about the rise of Camelot, and the unity of a once fractured land. The foul Saxons were driven back across the distant sea, and the people of the kingdom knew peace, justice and prosperity.\\n\\nTo any who think to cross Merlin, beware.

Most are embellished, the events polished to a legendary sheen. They say that Hua Mulan was blessed, that her bow and blade were gifts of the gods. That she was wise beyond measure, and stronger than a hundred warriors, for her heart was pure. That she became the sworn sister of the king\u2019s daughter. That she returned home and married a prince, or perhaps a farmer. That she died.\\n\\nBut every story, no matter how outlandish, has a grain of truth to it. And this is the truth of Hua Mulan. China was invaded and a man from every family was called to serve in the army. But her father was old and her brother a child, and so for love\u2019s sake, she set aside her loom and went to war in their place. She disguised herself as a young man, and no one was the wiser, for her father had trained her in the ways of the bow and the blade, making her the equal of any man in the army.\\n\\nFor twelve years, she maintained the pretence. She fought well against the enemies of China, attaining rank and the loyalty of her fellow soldiers. She led men into battle more than once, setting herself where the fighting was thickest so that those who followed her might see her and take heart. At the end of that twelve years, she was offered a high rank, but turned it down. Instead, having grown tired of war, she asked only that she might return home to her family. And so she did, her duty complete.\\n\\nBut some stories do not end when the hero returns home. For some stories, that is only the beginning. For now, a new danger stirs, and Hua Mulan must once more take up her weapons in defense of her homeland...","PhysicalPower":39,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/cross-strike.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.7,"Mana":220,"ManaPerLevel":38,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/mulan.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Mulan utilizes a Sword, Spear and Bow with her abilities and can gain Skill towards them by damaging enemy gods.

Accompanying him are two wolves and his two trusted ravens, Huginn (thought) and Muninn (memory), who fly around Midgard and return to Odin with all they see and hear.\\n\\nAs a sage, Odin travels disguised as a simple wanderer, seeking wisdom. His thirst for knowledge has come at great personal cost, having been hanged from the branches of Yggdrasil, the world tree, for nine days and nights and sacrificed one of his eyes to the Well of Wisdom.\\n\\nAs keeper of souls, Odin welcomes slain warriors to his mighty hall of Valhalla on the agreement they will aid him at Ragnarok. Favored female warriors become his elite Valkyrie that usher those worthy of entry to Valhalla.\\n\\nIt is in preparation for the final days of Ragnarok he does all this. For the seers claim his death will come at the fangs of the great wolf Fenrir, and like anyone, Odin seeks to change his fate. Yet, never once have the volva been mistaken.","PhysicalPower":38,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/lunge.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.63,"Mana":200,"ManaPerLevel":35,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/odin.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":3,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Odin is empowered as he escorts fallen warriors to Valhalla.

With his far-reaching gaze, he has seen that the thrones of the great pantheons are empty, and that god wars against god.\\n\\nIn his great wisdom, Olorun has realised that only a king can unite them.\\n\\nAnd he will be that king.

Though she is capable of great acts of destruction, and possesses the temper to provoke such acts, Pele is both destroyer and creator. It was through her mastery over the world\u2019s molten core that she wrought the Hawaiian Islands into being, forging them from the lava that ruptured forth from the mouths of her volcanoes. They are places of immense beauty, lush and brimming with life, and by looking upon and revelling in such beauty, you offer Pele worship.\\n\\nBorn of Kane Milohai, who wrought the earth, sky and heavens, and the Earth goddess Haumea, Pele is one of fourteen children, seven sisters and seven brothers. It is from the enmity between these siblings that Pele arrived in Hawaii, after her exile at the hands of Kane Milohai for her fiery temper and conflict with her sister Namakaokahai, goddess of the Sea. Pursued across the oceans by Namakaikahai, Pele wrought Hawaii into a paradise, making her home within the great calderas of the volcanoes that stand sentinel across the island chain.\\n\\nTo worship Pele is to grant one\u2019s devotion to a goddess of terrible power, one who can shape and render a grand, vibrant world into being at her slightest whim, and burn it to ashes just as quickly. But just as her worshippers are devoted to Pele, she devotes herself to them as a force of divine protection and care. She is a tireless defender of life and the people that dwell upon her islands, and any that seek to threaten them shall surely taste Pele\u2019s fire.","PhysicalPower":39,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"true","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/pyroclast.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.7,"Mana":240,"ManaPerLevel":40,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/pele.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.9,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"When Pele drops below 50% health her flame is set alight, and she gains increased Physical Power, Lifesteal and Ability Lifesteal.

What must it be like to live forever in the shadow of your brother? To be denied again and again that which you desire, despite the power of the wrathful seas at your command? So Poseidon broods on his throne at the ocean floor.\\n\\nAs a child, Poseidon and his brother, Hades, were consumed by their father, Cronus. Powerless to escape, it was left to mighty Zeus to free them and slay their patron. Together, they defeated the last of the Titans and ushered in a new age of dominance for Olympian Gods, but their freedom, their very lives, Zeus would never let either brother forget were owed to him. Even as the heavens, the underworld, and the seas were divided among them, Zeus positioned himself as king of all, and what was Poseidon to do but be thankful he had been spared a fate in his father\u2019s belly? So he retired to his new realm and began the pursuit of gathering worshippers.\\n\\nSoon rose a great ocean front city of mankind, and Poseidon presented himself as their God, but another had already come, Athena, Zeus\u2019 daughter. A competition was held \u2013 each God would offer a gift and the people would select their sponsor. Confident, Poseidon drove his Trident, a trophy from the battle against the Titans, into the ground and a limitless spring emerged, but the people found the water salty and undrinkable. Athena extended her hand and a graceful olive tree rose from the earth. Wood, food, and oil, all from one gift. The people decided and the city was called Athens.\\n\\nIt may be that Poseidon never desired greatness as Zeus did. Had his father never consumed him, had he never been made God of the Sea, had his brother never crowned himself King of the Gods, Poseidon might have lived contentedly, but that chance is gone. Now, with the very tides at his command, an army of sea beasts at his back, and the formidable Kraken at his call, the glowering God of the deep seeks to quench his thirsty rage and plunge all the world in endless, wrathful seas.","PhysicalPower":0,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/tidal-surge.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.5,"Mana":245,"ManaPerLevel":40,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/poseidon.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.6,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Poseidon's movement speed increases and his abilities do additional damage as his Tide Level increases.

Niord was a God of Summer and Skadi a Goddess of Winter. After a few years, they amicably parted ways.

Acts that sent Amaterasu into shameful hiding.\\n\\nCast low, Susano descended to earth on his way to the Underworld. He carried only his Ten-Span Sword, and regret for his actions. What had his defilements achieved but to envelop the world in darkness? This was his nature, to broil like a storm, to frighten and destroy what stood in his path.\\n\\nBut a storm could also herald life.\\n\\nAt a river side, Susano ventured upon an elderly couple, weeping and cradling their young daughter. Eight children, they\u2019d had once, but now only one remained; seven devoured by the eight-headed serpent. Susano was resolved. To atone for his crimes, to prove his father wrong, to better himself, Susano would slay this beast.\\n\\nEight traps he laid, one for each head of the creature, with eight tubs of aromatic saké as bait. Slithering forward, the Orochi spread its gruesome heads to drink from the trapped tubs. Susano cut the rope. Gates dropped. The heads were imprisoned. One by one, he chopped the eight necks, until only the wriggling tail remained. Sweeping his blade split the reptilian hide, leaving notches in his blade but revealing a brilliant sword inside: the Kusanagi-no-Tsurugi.\\n\\nTo his sister, he gave the blade. An act of atonement, but not an apology. His true nature would never change, but his intention could.\\n\\nThough seen on the battlefield of the Gods, Susano\u2019s fight is not truly against those foes, but within himself.

Yet his hammer, Mjolnir is nearly as famous as he is, and Thor will not be parted from it.\\n\\nOdin, the All-Father, bore many children, but none as well known nor as mighty as Thor, who had the strength to move mountains and the power to call lightning from the sky. Despite these incredible gifts, Thor\u2019s enemies were cunning, bloodthirsty, and numerous. The Frost Giants constantly threatened to invade Asgard requiring every ounce of Thor\u2019s near limitless strength just to keep them at bay. Had the tide truly turned, Asgard might have been destroyed, but a simple prank played by the treacherous Loki ended with the creation of Mjolnir, the legendary hammer, and with it, Thor utterly crushed the Frost Giants.\\n\\nSif, Thor\u2019s wife, had hair like rays of sun through a cloudy sky, and Loki, being covetous, secretly sheared it off while she slept. Mad with fury, Thor demanded Loki fix this. So, Loki went to the dwarves of Ivaldi who forged a golden crown that would grow equally golden hair, a spear that never missed its mark, and a ship that would never sink. Proud of his treasures, Loki returned to Thor and the other Gods, gave the crown to Sif, then bragged that no greater items could be forged.\\n\\nThe dwarf Brokk took offense to this and claimed that he and his brother could do better. Loki bet his head they could not. So, Brokk and his brother forged three items, a ring that made a duplicate every nine days, a golden pig that could fly and swim, and the hammer, Mjolnir, with the power to shatter mountains. As each item was forged, Brokk was bitten fiercely by a fly, yet only on the third did he flinch, causing the short handle on the hammer. When they were done, the dwarves took their artifacts before the Gods and decried Loki\u2019s fly disguise. All the Gods agreed that Brokk and his brother had forged greater items. Loki, ever cunning, declared his neck was not part of the bargain, denying them his head.\\n\\nMjolnir went to Thor to battle the Frost Giants. Proud and mighty, Thor beat back the evil horde and continues to defend Asgard to this day. With Mjolnir in hand, Thor is an unstoppable force that even other Gods would do well to avoid.","PhysicalPower":39,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/mjolnirs-attunement.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.69,"Mana":240,"ManaPerLevel":38,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/thor.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.9,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Thor gains Physical Power for each enemy god within 30 units of him.","rankitems":[{"description":"Physical Power:","value":"10"},{"description":"Max Stacks:","value":"3"}],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"80/90/100/110/120 ","cooldown":"110/105/100/95/90s","description":"After a short buildup, Thor leaps into the air.

Wielding his twin tonfa, Shingetsu and Mangetsu, he overcomes his enemies with effortless skill and a mocking laugh, forcing them to bow before him \u2013 for what good is victory without an audience to see it?\\n\\nHe is the opposite in every way of his sibling, Amaterasu. Where she is light, he is dark. Where she is kind, he is cruel. But in his cruelty there is purpose. A true leader cannot show weakness, cannot brook insult \u2013 even one unintentionally given.\\n\\nSuch was the reason that Tsukuyomi struck off the head of the goddess of plenty, Uke Mochi. For her manner offended him, and offense must be answered as swiftly and surely as possible, lest weakness be revealed. Order must be maintained, whatever the cost.\\n\\nAmaterasu did not understand. She cast Tsukuyomi from her sight, forever exiling him from the heavens. The day would be hers, and the night his. Another insult, but one Tsukuyomi has borne in silence...until now.\\n\\nFor now, the Great Dreamer has awakened and cast a shroud of madness across the world and its peoples. The order of all things breaks down, and weakling gods like Amaterasu falter.\\n\\nBut a true leader sees opportunity in chaos.\\n\\nThe time of Amaterasu and her followers is done. Tsukuyomi seeks to impose a new order upon things \u2013 one more to his liking. A long night falls across the world.\\n\\nAnd now, a new moon rises...","PhysicalPower":35,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/dark-moon-shuriken.jpg","AutoBanned":"y","HP5PerLevel":0.68,"Mana":205,"ManaPerLevel":35,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/tsukuyomi.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.8,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"Tsukuyomi wields Shingetsu in his left hand and Mangetsu in his right hand.

Vamana, the Fifth Avatar of Vishnu, should never be underestimated. His harsh lessons in humility have shamed even the proudest of kings.\\n\\nThe demon king, Bali, was fair and righteous, yet for all his virtues, Bali was extremely proud and driven by fierce ambition. After conquering the Underworld and all the Earth, Bali managed to wrest the Heavens from the God Indra. Unable to reclaim his seat, Indra implored Vishnu for aid, and so Vishnu took the form of a small mortal man, a priest named Vamana.\\n\\nIn his splendid palace, Bali was giving gifts to the pious. Vishnu, disguised as the monk Vamana and carrying a wooden umbrella, requested only as much land as he could cover in three steps. Bali offered Vamana an island but Vamana stuck to his request, which Bali granted against the wishes of his advisor. Immediately, Vamana grew to cosmic proportions, crashing through the ceiling of the palace and filling the sky. With one colossal step, he engulfed all the Earth and the Underworld. With a second step, he consumed the heavens. Now, with everything under his two units, Vamana had nowhere to place his third step. He challenged Bali to go back on his word or offer somewhere else for him to step. Bali\u2019s demon army surged forth, but the demon king held them back. Bowing in humility, Bali offered his head as the third step. Vamana sends Bali to the underworld but, in recognizing Bali\u2019s benevolence, shows mercy by granting him sovereignty over it in appreciation of Bali\u2019s sacrifice.\\n\\nVishnu returned control of the Heavens to Indra and left his Avatar behind, but he also left behind a valuable lesson. Even the mightiest and most arrogant of kings can be humbled by the smallest of men.","PhysicalPower":37,"MagicProtection":30,"OnFreeRotation":"true","godAbility1_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-abilities/clear-the-path.jpg","AutoBanned":"n","HP5PerLevel":0.5,"Mana":200,"ManaPerLevel":39,"godCard_URL":"https://web2.hirez.com/smite/god-cards/vamana.jpg","PhysicalProtectionPerLevel":2.9,"abilityDescription5":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"","cooldown":"","description":"A percentage of Vamana's Physical Protection is converted to Physical Power.","rankitems":[{"description":"Physical Protection Conversion:","value":"20%"}],"menuitems":[{"description":"Ability:","value":"Buff"},{"description":"Affects:","value":"Self"}]}},"abilityDescription4":{"itemDescription":{"cost":"100","cooldown":"90s","description":"Vamana grows to an enormous giant for 6s gaining immunity to Crowd Control, Protections, Physical Power, regeneration and his Basic Attacks now damage all nearby enemies.

In secret, Zeus grew up on the isle of Crete until he was old and strong enough to challenge his father.

Chiefly, Zeus is nearly infamous for several infidelities to his wife which have resulted in dozens of children beget by other women, most famous of which are Hercules, Artemis, and Athena.
